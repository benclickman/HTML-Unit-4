		<h1> Video Editing: The Manipulation and Arrangement of Video Shots </h1>
		<h2> Video Editing falls in the film department. </h2>
		<p> I am interested in Video Editing because I like to just edit photos or videos in my own time and I find it fun.
		I like to create videos and photos that make people laugh. I feel like it would be a fun career to have because it's
		something I enjoy to do.
